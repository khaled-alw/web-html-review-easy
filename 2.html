        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by Polish developer CD Projekt and is based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third main installment in the The Witcher's video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective. Players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt, an otherworldly force determined to capture her and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. Its central story has several endings, determined by the player's choices at certain points in the game.
